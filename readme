2. Get the CR approved before merging to the dev branch.

3. Once approved, merge to the master branch.

4. After merging to master, tag the release with a relevant version number and update release notes. Trigger the specified pipeline.

5. Create a Release Request using the provided link.

6. Before seeking Release Request approval:
   - Ensure the final Octopus package is deployed to the test environment and pre-prod.
   - Test rollback in pre-prod.

7. Promote the Release Request (RR) for approval.
